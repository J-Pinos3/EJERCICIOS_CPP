## Let's Talk About Single Linked List

### The Definitions
A linked List in its simpliest form is a collection of `nodes` that together form a linear ordering where each node stores a `next` pointer to the next node of the list.

The `next` pointer inside a node is a link or pointer to the next node of the list.

The first and last nodes of a linked list are called head and tail.
- The tail is the node with a null `next` reference

This data structure is called singly linked list because each node stores a single link.

`Like an array, a singly linked list maintains its elements in a certain order, also It can be resized by adding or removing nodes.`
